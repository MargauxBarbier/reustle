## Travel

While I did spend a majority of the year in Tokyo (8 months), I was able to make it to a bunch of other interesting places too. Taiwan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, USA, a ship from Vancouver to Alaska to Japan, Spain, Morocco, and then Canada.

I've still been slowing down on the travel side, choosing to spend more time in each place. I feel it has less to do with the urge to keep moving, and more to do with wanting to focus on work.

My tentative 2018 plan is to stay in New York until May or June, and then jump over to Europe for the rest of the summer. Afterwards, I'll head further east to Asia where I'll spend winter. TBD.


## Business

Quite a bit of time was spent this year honing the core focus of the business, which is now branded as [Reustle Co.](https://reustle.co). The majority of our work has been around information dashboards, automating business processes, and integrations with commercial-level IoT devices.

After working with a few fun clients in Tokyo, I'm back in New York again for at least the first half of 2018. We've already onboarded a couple new clients since the new year, and I'm really excited to be on the ground again here working with great people.

## Life

Mental health. Happy, lots of time to reflect over past 3 years (always some new perspective), digging deeper into happiness, depression, and 'chasing ghosts'. Building deep relationships is hard when you don't put roots down for extended periods of time.

Really excited to reconnect on a deeper level with old New York friends, and make new ones. Will also be spending at least half of my time working with my hands, on my property in Pennsylvania. Treehouse on the island? Animals (huskies), nature, and the freedom that a car gives that is generally much harder to get while traveling (tied to public transit). I _really_ miss driving / riding.
