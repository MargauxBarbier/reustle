At age 24, I left New York and set out on a mission to circumnavigate the planet entirely by train and ship before age 30. Fortunately, I completed the trip with about a year to spare, and only 3 months before the coronavirus pandemic began.

I traveled across 41 countries, roughly 48,000 km by train and 17,900 km by boat.
