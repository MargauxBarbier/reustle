                        I'm <strong>Shane Reustle</strong>, an avid traveler and software engineer.
                        Unsatisfied with sedentary office life in New York City, I set out on a mission to slowly make my way around the world by land and sea.
                        So far I've explored over <a href='http://reustle.org/rtw' target='_blank'>35 countries</a> by bus, train, boat, and motorcycle.
                        Meanwhile, I've been busy building a <a href='https://reustle.co'>fully remote software company</a> which has worked with a diverse set of clients to produce some exciting new products.

                I've quickly come to realize that life is best spent focusing on your passions and building a career around them, not the other way around.
                I hope you enjoy <a href='https://www.facebook.com/reustle'>my photos</a> as a narrow glimpse into my recent adventures.
