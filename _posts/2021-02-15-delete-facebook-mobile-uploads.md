Facebook does not give you the option to delete your Mobile Uploads photo album. If you've got a few thousand photos here, you need to manually delete them individually, which takes quite a long time.

I've created a simple script that you can run within your browsers console to click `edit`, `delete photo`, and `confirm` automatically for you, one-by-one.
