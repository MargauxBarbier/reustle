For the second year, I'm volunteering with the [Brooklyn Bridge Park Boathouse](http://www.bbpboathouse.org/) to offer free kayaking. You can join us Thursdays between 5:30pm and 6:30pm and Saturdays between 10:30am and 4:30pm. Just show up, sign the waiver and grab a life jacket. We'll teach you the basics of paddling and answer any questions you have before you head out. Note that you will get a bit wet, but isn't that the point? See you on the water!
