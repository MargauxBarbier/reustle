<p>Here are some notes I put together after living in Ubud for 2 months. Bali has a unique vibe, and it will likely grow on you. If you’re not already sold on Bali, you should read <a href='https://medium.com/@onlybloodyhuman/the-b-option-67864bfbf5a9'>Jamie Fulbrook's thoughts on it</a>.<p>

<h2>Connectivity</h2>
<p>Grab a <b>Telkomsel</b> sim card from the airport. More info is available on the <a href='http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/Indonesia'>prepaid data sim wiki</a> as usual.</p>


<h2>Accommodation</h2>
<p>One of the best ways to find a villa in Bali is through the various Facebook groups.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ubud housing groups [<a href='https://www.facebook.com/groups/UbudMonthlyRentals/'>Group 1</a>, <a href='https://www.facebook.com/groups/1523008504577896/'>Group 2</a>]</li>
    <li>Canggu housing groups [<a href='https://www.facebook.com/groups/1380848555535084/'>Group 1</a>, <a href='https://www.facebook.com/groups/746999628699757/'>Group 2</a>]</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also find plenty via AirBnB or by just walking around town knocking on doors and asking in the coworking spaces. If internet speed is important to you, ask to test the wifi connection before committing to renting a place out long term. Internet connection speeds are a mixed bag in Bali.</p>


<h2>Neighborhoods</h2>
<p>I prefer staying in Ubud, due to it being very walkable and filled with great food, but if you’re looking to surf and are ok with relying on a motorbike, you may want to check out Canggu. They’re only about 1 hour apart, so you can easily travel between both for around 300k IDR (taxi).
<ul>
	<li><b>Ubud</b>: Almost everyone who lives here does yoga / meditation. Many good restaurants (western and local), art, jungle vibes, walkable, hills and valleys. Some car traffic in the afternoon, but still navigable by bike.</li>
	<li><b>Canggu</b>: Almost everyone who lives here surfs. Good food (but a bit spread apart), more partying, a bit more spread out and quiet.</li>
	<li><b>Seminyak</b>: A bit more upscale (resorts), quieter.</li>
	<li><b>Kuta</b>: A cesspool of partying Australians.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Transportation</h2>
<p>If you’re planning on living in Ubud, it is possible to live happily without a motorbike as long as you’re within a few minutes of the main 4 roads which form the rectangle. In Canggu, you’ll almost definitely need a bike.</p>
If you’re comfortable with riding, and would like one for going on trips outside of town, you can easily find one for 500–700k IDR per month.
<p>Taxi prices are generally pretty cheap, around 4o-80k in Ubud or 250–450k for further distances like Canggu. The prices are nearly always negotiable.</p>
<p>Uber / Grab / GoJek (local), etc are pretty difficult to work with here, but possible. The local taxi mafia hates them, and will not hesitate to bother you or even chase you around if you’re caught trying to get an uber.</p>


<h2>Workplaces</h2>
<p>There are a bunch of great cafes and coworking spaces to work from around Ubud. Here are a few of my favorites:</p>
