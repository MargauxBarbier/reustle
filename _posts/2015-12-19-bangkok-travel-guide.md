Here are some quick and dirty tips I’ve picked up while living here for a few months. Bangkok is a great city, and you’ll fall in love with the countless night markets, chaotic streets, and delicious (dirt cheap) street food.

## Connectivity

You’ll want to pick up a TRUE sim card and ask for any of the monthly 4G plans (not a tourist plan). They offer a good amount of data for the price like 2.5 GB for 300 bhat/mo, 5 GB for 700 bhat/mo, etc. You’ll also get unlimited access to WiFi hotspots all over the city.

To get your WiFi password, dial <b>*871*4#</b> and you’ll get an sms shortly after. Your username is your local phone number.


## Accomodation

* [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/c/sreustle?s=4) has a bunch of listings for beautiful, cheap apartments. Many of them are available on a monthly basis at a lower price.
* If you’re just passing through, [Lub D](http://lubd.com/siamsquare/) (Siam Square location) is a clean, cheap hostel in a great location. They have a helpful staff and plenty of travelers hanging out around the lobby looking for an adventure in the city.


## Neighborhoods

* Siam is the center of the city. Both of the train lines meet here, and there are plenty of malls, restaurants, and people. I usually stay here since everything I need is within walking distance, but it can feel a bit too western at times.
* The Ekkamai / Thonglor area is a popular choice with expats, and is only about 6 km east of Siam (5 stops on the BTS Skytrain). This is where you’ll find the popular coworking spaces and plenty of restaurants.
* Khao San Road and the surrounding area is filled with backpackers and bars. You’ll find plenty of loud music, booze, and even the occasional street vendor selling bugs you can eat (like scorpions).

## Transportation

* There are 3 train networks in the city, the BTS Skytrain, the MRT Subway, and the Airport Rail Link. They are all cheap, clean, and on time. Note that the trains stop running at midnight.
* Uber and Grab are the easiest ways to grab a cab (or motorbike taxi) in the city. Coverage is fairly robust and the drivers are friendly.
* Taxis are very cheap, and will usually take you anywhere you want. When getting in, make sure they turn the meter on. If they offer you a price, it is likely much higher than what the meter will charge you. If they refuse, get out and find another cab.
* Avoid tuk tuks, as they’re for tourists and will likely overcharge you. They are worth taking once or twice just for the experience, but expect to pay somewhere around 150–250 bhat.
* Motorcycle taxis are a great way to beat the traffic. They’re cheap, and they’re loads of fun! Just be careful and hold on tight as you weave through traffic.
* Khlong boats are an exciting way to get across town!
* If you’re going to be around the city for more than a few days, pick up a Rabbit Card for use on the BTS and MRT to avoid digging around for change every time you need to ride. Ask for one at any ticket counter.


## Activities

* Climb the <a href='http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bangkoks-ghost-tower-the-sathorn-unqiue'>Sathorn Unique Tower</a>, also known as the Ghost Tower. This is <a href='http://bangkok.coconuts.co/2015/09/17/sathorn-unique-owner-files-complaint-against-team-farang-trespassing'>getting more difficult</a> as more people try to go, but the view is beautiful (pictured above). (Update Mar 2016: it is apparently surrounded by police and impossible to get in).
* Explore abandoned commercial airliners in the <a href='http://blog.bucketlistly.com/post/144147609981/abandoned-airplane-graveyard-bangkok-ramkhamheang'>Airplane Graveyard</a>.
* Take a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khlong_Saen_Saep_boat_service'>Khlong boat</a> across town and experience a whole new side of the city.
* Bicycle through Bangkrachao (aka The Green Lung) in southern Bangkok. <a href='https://www.couchsurfing.com/events/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search_query=Bangkok&latitude=13.783362&longitude=100.342133&country=&region=&start_date=&end_date=&keyword=Bangkrachao'>This is a fantastic monthly event</a> put on by the couchsurfing community where you’ll make lots of new friends. Pictured below.
* Wander around the <a href='http://www.bangkoktourist.com/site/en/train-night-market-srinakarin/'>Srinakarin Train Night Market</a> or the <a href='http://www.bangkok.com/shopping-market/popular-markets.htm'>Chatuchak Weekend Market</a>.
* Enjoy the authentic <a href='http://www.bangkok.com/magazine/amphawa.htm'>Amphawa Floating Market</a> about 1.5 hours west of the city. It is easily <a href='http://wikitravel.org/en/Amphawa#Get_in'>accessible by van</a> from Victory Monument.
* Explore <a href='https://thecommonsbkk.com/'>The Commons</a> community space, and grab a bite to eat at <a href='https://thecommonsbkk.com/shop/roast'>Roast</a>.

## Workplaces

There are a few nice coworking spaces popping up around Bangkok, here are a few I enjoyed.

* <a href='https://www.facebook.com/GrowthCafeAndCo/'>Growth Cafe &amp; Co</a> is a cozy co-working space popular with locals and open until midnight. Located 130 meters from the Siam BTS station.
* <a href='http://www.glowfishoffices.com/'>Glowfish</a> is a very new co-working space in Siam which offers day passes and private monthly offices. Located 20 meters from the Siam BTS station.
* <a href='http://wolfcoworking.com/'>Wolf co-working space</a> is a beautiful new space in Silom. Located 430 meters from the Surasak BTS station.
* There are a few more popular co-working spaces, but some are a bit far from the nearest train stations. <a href='http://www.launchpad.co.th/'>Launchpad</a> (380 meters to BTS), <a href='http://hubbathailand.com/'>Hubba</a> (870 meters to BTS), and <a href='http://thehive.co.th/'>The Hive</a> (912 meters to BTS).
* My favorite coffee shop to work at in the city is any <a href='http://truecoffee.truecorp.co.th/'>TRUE Coffee</a> location. They’re all over the place and usually have a few tables open. If you’ve got a TRUE sim card, you also have unlimited access to their fast WiFi network (see above) which is up to 200 mbps at many locations.
* <a href='https://www.facebook.com/toofasttosleep'>Too Fast Too Sleep</a> is a popular 24 hour cafe with students. It has a “productive” atmosphere and plenty of tables, but is a bit far from the BTS &amp; MRT.
* <a href='http://en.tomntoms.com/main.php'>Tom n Toms Coffee</a> is another solid 24 hour cafe option, with multiple locations. Some locations are no longer 24 hours, so double check before you get too cozy.
